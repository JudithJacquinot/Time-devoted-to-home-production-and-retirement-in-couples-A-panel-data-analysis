Retirement is one of the main economic and social changes in the lives of most individuals and
their households. Most people retire abruptly from a full-time job to a situation where they no
longer take part in paid work. This not only affects their personal and household income, but also
their social network and the activities on which they spend their time. For individuals in couples,
retirement of husband or wife may have an important impact on the partner through household
income, but also through the changes in the time spent by the retired partner on, for example,
household production.
